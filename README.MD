# Express TypeScript Exploration Project

This project demonstrates the use of [Express](https://expressjs.com/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), providing a structured way to build server-side applications using modern JavaScript features and strong typing support. The primary aim is to explore and leverage TypeScript's capabilities within an Express environment for improved development experience, scalability, and maintainability.

## Features

- **TypeScript Integration**: Benefit from static typing, interfaces, and type inference to catch errors early and improve code quality.
- **Express Framework**: Build robust APIs with route handling, middleware support, and error handling.
- **Best Practices**: Emphasis on clean code architecture, modularization, and reusable components.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Demonstrate event-driven patterns for enhanced application flexibility.
- **Middleware and Error Handling**: Comprehensive use of middleware functions and error handling mechanisms.
